============================================================
ANSWER (after 0 replans, 7 tasks):
============================================================
3M is NOT capital-intensive. CapEx/Revenue (5.11%) falls significantly below the 15-20% threshold for capital-intensive businesses. PPE/Assets (19.76%) is below the 25-35% benchmark, though PPE/Revenue (26.81%) exceeds typical ranges. The low CapEx intensity and below-threshold asset utilization indicate 3M operates as a moderate-capital business with efficient asset deployment and operational leverage, characteristic of diversified industrials with strong cash generation.
