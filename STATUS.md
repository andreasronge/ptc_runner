## Implementation Progress

Based on `docs/architecture.md` phases:

### Phase 1: Core Interpreter
- [ ] JSON parsing with Jason
- [ ] Basic operations: `literal`, `load`, `var`, `pipe`
- [ ] Collection operations: `filter`, `map`, `select`
- [ ] Aggregations: `sum`, `count`
- [ ] Sandbox with timeout and heap limits
- [ ] Execution metrics

### Phase 2: Query Operations
- [ ] Nested path access: `get`
- [ ] Comparisons: `eq`, `neq`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, `contains`
- [ ] More aggregations: `avg`, `min`, `max`
- [ ] Collection: `first`, `last`, `nth`, `reject`

### Phase 3: Logic & Variables
- [ ] Logic: `and`, `or`, `not`, `if`
- [ ] Variables: `let` bindings
- [ ] Combine: `merge`, `concat`

### Phase 4: Tool Integration
- [ ] Tool registry and `call` operation
- [ ] Integration tests with mock tools
- [ ] E2E test with LLM

### Phase 5: Polish
- [ ] Error messages optimized for LLM consumption
- [ ] Validation with helpful suggestions
- [ ] Documentation and examples
- [ ] Hex package preparation

## If Status is STUCK

When PM workflow is stuck, check:

1. **Review the failure table above** - What went wrong?
2. **Check open issues** - `gh issue list`
3. **Check recent PRs** - `gh pr list --state all`
4. **Manual intervention needed** - Create/update an issue manually, or adjust architecture.md

To resume:
1. Fix the underlying problem
2. Update this file: set status to "Active", reset failure count
3. PM workflow will resume on next trigger
