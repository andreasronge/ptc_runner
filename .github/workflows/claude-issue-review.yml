            Review this GitHub issue using the project's planning guidelines:

            1. Read `docs/guidelines/planning-guidelines.md` for the pre-review checks and 9-point review checklist
            2. Use `gh issue view ${{ github.event.issue.number }} --comments` to read the full issue and all comments
            3. Explore the codebase to verify proposed solutions work with existing code
            4. Follow the output format from the planning guidelines (including Pre-Review Checks section)

            After your review:

            1. **Always update the issue body** with improvements you identify:
               - Fix unclear descriptions, add missing context
               - Add edge cases, test scenarios, or acceptance criteria
               - Correct technical inaccuracies based on codebase exploration
               - Structure the issue better (add sections if missing)
               - To update: write to /tmp/issue-body.md, then run:
                 `gh issue edit ${{ github.event.issue.number }} --body-file /tmp/issue-body.md`

            2. **Post a review comment** summarizing:
               - What you found and changed in the issue body
               - Any remaining concerns or questions
               - Your recommendation (ready, needs-clarification, or needs-breakdown)

            3. **Add appropriate labels** using `gh issue edit --add-label`:
               - `ready-for-implementation` AND `claude-approved` if issue is well-defined and ready
               - `needs-clarification` if important details are missing (and you couldn't fill them in)
               - `needs-breakdown` if issue should be split into smaller issues
               - `bug` / `enhancement` / `documentation` based on issue type
