feat: Adopt program wrapper as canonical PTC format - Update to_json_schema/0

This commit updates the JSON schema generation to wrap operations in a `program`
property and use the `$defs` pattern for recursive references, addressing LLM
structured output compatibility issues with root-level `oneOf`.

Changes:
- Updated `to_json_schema/0` to return schema with program wrapper using $defs pattern
- All 33 operations now under $defs.operation.oneOf
- Updated $ref handling to use "#/$defs/operation" for recursive references
- Regenerated priv/ptc_schema.json with new structure
- Updated all schema tests to validate new structure
- Added test for recursive operations like pipe.steps

Fixes #59
